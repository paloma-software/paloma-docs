# Paloma Workflow Guide: Handling Inquiries Like a Pro

Welcome to your Paloma workflow guide! In this quick reference, we’ll walk you through three common scenarios so you can handle inquiries smoothly and keep your guests and vendors happy.

## Scenario 1: The Standard Paloma Flow

Most of the time, you’ll just follow this simple flow when a new inquiry comes in. Here’s how it works:

| Step                   | Where         | Who           | What Happens                                          | Icon Idea     |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Guest Sends Inquiry | Paloma Widget | Guest         | The guest submits their event inquiry on your site.   | 📝 (Form)     |
| 2. Paloma Emails Both  | Email         | Paloma System | Paloma sends emails to both the guest and the vendor. | 📧 (Envelope) |
| 3. Vendor Replies All  | Email         | Vendor        | The vendor replies-all to keep everyone in the loop.  | 🔄 (Reply)    |

## Scenario 2: Handling a Forwarded Inquiry

Sometimes you’ll get an inquiry forwarded from outside Paloma. Here’s how to bring it into the system:

| Step                       | Where               | Who          | What to Do                                                         | Icon Idea     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| 1. Get the Forwarded Email | In your email inbox | You (Vendor) | Open the forwarded email from the outside sender.                  | 📧 (Envelope) |
| 2. Create a New Inquiry    | Paloma Dashboard    | You (Vendor) | Add the inquiry details into Paloma to start a new thread.         | 📋 (Form)     |
| 3. Start the Conversation  | Paloma Dashboard    | You (Vendor) | Send the first message to kick off the Paloma-managed email chain. | ✉️ (Mail)     |
| 4. Keep the Thread Going   | Dashboard or Email  | You & Guest  | Continue replying from either tool that’s convenient.              | 🔄 (People)   |

## Scenario 3: Taking Over an Existing Inquiry

When a teammate is out, you might need to step in and handle an ongoing conversation. Here’s how:

| Step                           | Where              | Who          | What to Do                                                     | Icon Idea       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1. Open the Dashboard          | Paloma Dashboard   | You (Vendor) | Check recent inquiries and find the one that needs you.        | 🖥️ (Dashboard) |
| 2. Review the Thread           | Paloma Dashboard   | You (Vendor) | Review the existing messages to get up to speed.               | 📄 (Thread)     |
| 3. Send Your Intro Reply       | Paloma Dashboard   | You (Vendor) | Let the guest know you’re here to help and continue the convo. | ✉️ (Mail)       |
| 4. Keep the Conversation Going | Dashboard or Email | You & Guest  | Continue the conversation from wherever works best.            | 🔄 (Reply)      |

# Paloma Workflow Guide: Handling Inquiries Like a Pro

Welcome to your Paloma workflow guide! In this quick reference, we’ll walk you through three common scenarios so you can handle inquiries smoothly and keep your guests and vendors happy.

---

## Scenario 1: The Standard Paloma Flow

Most of the time, you’ll just follow this simple flow when a new inquiry comes in. Here’s how it works:

| Step                      | Where         | Who (Actor)   | What Happens                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Guest Sends Inquiry 📝 | Paloma Widget | Guest         | The guest submits their event inquiry on your site via the Paloma widget.           |
| 2. Paloma Sends Emails 📧 | Email         | Paloma System | Paloma sends the same message to both the guest and the vendor to start the thread. |
| 3. You Reply-All 🔄       | Email         | You (Vendor)  | You reply-all to the guest, and by doing so, keep Paloma in the loop.               |

## Scenario 2: Handling a Forwarded Inquiry

Sometimes you’ll get an inquiry outside of Paloma — maybe someone emails you directly or forwards a request. You can easily bring it into Paloma with a quick forward. Here's how:

| Step                          | Where                                             | Who (Actor)  | What to Do                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Get the Forwarded Email 📧 | Email Inbox                                       | You (Vendor) | Open the inquiry you received from outside of Paloma.                                                                                                                                          |
| 2. Forward to Paloma 📬       | Email                                             | You (Vendor) | Forward it to **[concierge@palomaparties.com](mailto:concierge@palomaparties.com)**. You can include a note like *“Please add this as Booked”* to set a status.                                |
| 3. Log In to Paloma 🔐        | [Paloma Dashboard](https://app.palomaparties.com) | You (Vendor) | Head to your [dashboard](https://app.palomaparties.com) to view recent activity.                                                                                                               |
| 4. Find and Reply ✉️          | Dashboard                                         | You (Vendor) | Locate the new inquiry and click **Reply** to send a message to the guest. Any reply sent from the dashboard will automatically CC you, so you stay looped in even if the guest replies later. |
| 5. Keep the Thread Going 🔄   | Dashboard or Email                                | You & Guest  | Continue the conversation from the dashboard or your inbox — whichever works best.                                                                                                             |

## Scenario 3: Taking Over an Existing Inquiry

If a teammate is out, you might need to step in and handle an ongoing conversation. Here's how to take over a thread smoothly:

| Step                              | Where                                             | Who (Actor)  | What to Do                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Open the Dashboard 🖥️         | [Paloma Dashboard](https://app.palomaparties.com) | You (Vendor) | Check recent inquiries at [app.palomaparties.com](https://app.palomaparties.com) and find the one that needs your attention. |
| 2. Review the Thread 📄           | Paloma Dashboard                                  | You (Vendor) | Read the existing message history to get up to speed on the conversation.                                                    |
| 3. Send Your Intro Reply ✉️       | Paloma Dashboard                                  | You (Vendor) | Send a reply letting the guest know you’re stepping in and happy to help.                                                    |
| 4. Keep the Conversation Going 🔄 | Dashboard or Email                                | You & Guest  | Continue the thread from wherever works best for you — dashboard or inbox.                                                   |

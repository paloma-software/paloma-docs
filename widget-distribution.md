# Widget Distribution

## Steps

The main thing you need handy is the link to your widget. If you already have that, you can skip ahead.

1. Login to the Paloma Vendor App in your web browser of choice: https://app.palomaparties.com/
1. Click **Businesses** at the top.
1. Click on the Venue or Business you're working with right now.
1. Click on the **Links and Installation** submenu on the left (or top if on mobile)
1. Scroll to the **Widget Link** section.
1. Click on the **Copy Widget Link** button, and paste the Url somewhere you can retrieve it later.

Now that you have your URL you can copy it into any number of places to aid in distribution:

- Instagram Links ([Instagram Help Page](https://help.instagram.com/362497417173378))
- Link in Bio tools such as [Link Tree](https://linktr.ee/)
- Any other social posts you can think of!
- Email signatures

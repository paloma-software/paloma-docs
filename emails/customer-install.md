Hey Folks!

Excited to see you this morning and get your website updated.

I'll be running through a series of steps to make edits to your shopify website. I've included a few snippets we'll need for the website in the email below, just to make it easy to copy and paste.

No need to read this now! We'll walk through it together.

Here is the install snippet:

```
<script>(function(window,document){if(window.palcon){console.error("palcon embed already included");return}window.palcon={_c:[]};["init"].forEach((me=>window.palcon[me]=function(){window.palcon._c.push([me,arguments])}));var elt=document.createElement("script");elt.type="module";elt.async=true;elt.src=`https://widget.app.palomaparties.com/shim.js`;var before=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];before.parentNode.insertBefore(elt,before)})(window,document);
palcon.init("79be5912-276e-4e8e-a281-3203c1e4e2d1");</script>
```

Here is a sample button you can use (may need to be adjusted):

```
<a class="palconTrigger button button--primary" href="javascript:void(0);">Plan your Event</a>
```

And here is a preview of the rough steps we'll be following here:

See you soon!
